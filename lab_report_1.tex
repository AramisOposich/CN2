\section{Task and Protocol Description} \label{sec:task}

The subject of the first task is to observe email clientâ€™s network traffic and to extract the username and password from the client.  Furthermore this assignment offers some reflections on the security aspects of protocols using plaintext on network traffic.

\subsection{Internet Message Access Protocol}
The IMAP protocol is used by email clients to retrieve email messages from a mail server over a TCP connection. The protocol has been defined in the RFC 3501. Usually an IMAP server typically listens on port number 143, like our first task did. The more secure way is to run IMAP over SSL/TLS, which is assigned the port number 993.

\subsubsection{Authentication}
As this report will show, the IMAP protocol contains an authentication message, which leaks the vulnerability. The user must authenticate himself before he can gain access to mail. This is done by logging in with his username and password. The password is transmitted in plain text at the IMAP protocol level. Mail servers can therefore forbid clients from transmitting the password if no encrypted session has been established beforehand.\\

Furthermore IMAP has an extension for \textbf{PLAIN Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)}\cite{zeilenga2006plain} which was designed to have a wider interoperability with other systems. The main drawback is shown in the first assignment, capturing the username and password of the client.

\section{Procedure} \label{sec:procedure}
This section describes the different steps that are needed to recover the forgotten email password from the network traffic between the email client and the email server. 
\subsection{Traffic capture with WireShark} \label{subsec:capture}
First all incoming and outgoing traffic needs to be captured by using WireShark. 
To reduce the number of captured packets the capture filter "\verb|not port 22|" was used because this prevents the SSH traffic from being captured as well. 
To get the IMAP authentication message Thunderbird was launched right after the capturing process was started, which was then terminated again after about 20 seconds.
\subsection{Filter captured traffic} \label{subsec:filter}
In order to show only the required IMAP messages the display filter "\verb|imap|" was used. 
Before that, the filter "\verb|pop|" was applied to exclude the usage of the Post Office Protocol for mail query. 
A screen shot of WireShark with the IMAP filter applied can be seen in \cref{fig:ws}. 
To see the whole traffic between the mail server and the client and not just the IMAP traffic, the source IP address of the first IMAP respose message was used as filter (\verb|ipv6.addr == 2001:629:2600:a018::1|).
This was not mandatory to retrieve the password but helped to understand the initial connection establishment.

\end{figure} 

\subsection{Decode messages and find password} \label{subsec:decode}
As already explained in \cref{sec:task} the client requests to authenticate with plane text and sends its credentials in the fourth exchanged IMAP message to the server. 
Because the credentials are encoded in UTF-8, it is necessary to decode the message string by using the following shell command in the terminal:
\begin{verbatim}
$ base64 -di <<<AGNuXzA2QGV4MS5jbjJsYWIuY24udHV3aWVuLmFjLmF0AFBlZ3Vxb3Rhc2Uy
$ cn_06@ex1.cn2lab.cn.tuwien.ac.atPeguqotase2
\end{verbatim}
In the returned string it is easy to identify the email address followed by the password which is in our case \verb|Peguqotase2|.

\section{Conclusion}

This shows how easy it is for attackers to retrieve passwords from plain text email traffic. Therefore, it is very important to make sure that all connections to the email server are TLS/SSL encrypted. With IMAP this can be done explicitly over port 143, by using the STARTTLS command, or implicitly over port 993 which enforces a encrypted connection.
